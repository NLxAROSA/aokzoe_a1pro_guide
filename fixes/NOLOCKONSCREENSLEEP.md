** Don't want the lock screen + PIN to appear every time your screen goes to sleep? **

1. Go to `Start` > `Settings` > `Personalization` > `Lock Screen`
2. In `Personalize your lock screen`, select `Slideshow` instead of the default value `Windows Spotlight` (or `Picture`, depending on your system). This makes new options appear below.
3. Navigate to `Advanced Slidehow` > `Settings` and untick `When PC is inactive, show the lock screen instead of turning off the screen`
That's it! Feel free to revert back from Slideshow to Windows spotlight afterwards, it will maintain the setting.
