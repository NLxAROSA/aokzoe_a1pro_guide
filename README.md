## Day-1 user guide

### Things you should never do

* NEVER install the A1 (AMD Ryzen 7 6800U) BIOS on the A1 Pro (AMD Ryzen 7 7840U). Different platform, may brick your device. Same for vice versa.

### Things you should always do

## Tricks and tips

### Remapping hotkeys

See below picture for an overview of the configured hotkeys and how they map to the buttons on the A1 Pro. You can use a tool such as [Powertoys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager) to remap them if needed.

### Fresh Windows 11 installations

If you replaced the SSD or just want to do a fresh Windows 11 installation, you might end up spending a lot of time collecting all the required device drivers for graphics, audio, accellerometer, etc. You can save a lot of time by using the 'Driver archive' from the links section. This contains all the necessary drivers. From Device Manager, select the top level element (name of your device) and right click it, then select 'install drivers'. It will take a few minutes and afterwards everything will be there. Reboot and you're all good to go.
