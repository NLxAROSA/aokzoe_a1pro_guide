# Unofficial user guide for the AOKZOE A1 Pro handheld computer

Hi, and welcome to the unofficial user guide for the AOKZOE A1 Pro handheld computer! This guide contains essential information to get you started, do's and don'ts as well as essential reading material and online communities. Always a work in progress, so feel free to raise issues, or better yet: pull requests if you think someting should be changed or added.

## Day-1 user guide

### Things you should never do

* NEVER install the A1 (AMD Ryzen 7 6800U) BIOS on the A1 Pro (AMD Ryzen 7 7840U). Different platform, may brick your device. Same for vice versa. This WILL brick your device.

### Things you should always do

* Always check the [Official AOKZOE and community Discord](https://t.co/l34hV0bSfA), it has the latest updates/news, direct access to AOKZOE and a very competent community.

## Troubleshooting

* [OneXConsoler/Player Center not opening or not showing content](fixes/PLAYERCENTREFIXES.md)
* [Don't lock the screen when screen goes to sleep](fixes/NOLOCKONSCREENSLEEP.md)

## Tricks and tips

* [Realtek Audio Console EQ settings for better sound on inbuild Speakers from A1 Pro](howtos/realtek.md) 

### Remapping hotkeys

See below picture for an overview of the configured hotkeys and how they map to the buttons on the A1 Pro. You can use a tool such as [Powertoys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager) to remap them if needed.

### Fresh Windows 11 installations

If you replaced the SSD or just want to do a fresh Windows 11 installation, you might end up spending a lot of time collecting all the required device drivers for graphics, audio, accellerometer, etc. You can save a lot of time by using [Fabnaz's driver archive](https://mega.nz/file/TVxAwLzA#QutamkUqTFG8rOHeGcQwPidjfqIGTdCb1EWCjFbLbSc). This contains all the necessary drivers. From Device Manager, select the top level element (name of your device) and right click it, then select 'install drivers'. It will take a few minutes and afterwards everything will be there. Reboot and you're all good to go.

## BIOS files

Do `NOT` flash BIOS and/or EC if you don't have any problems, do `NOT` flash BIOS and/or EC to other AOKZOE models, such as the A1 and do `NOT` flash A1 BIOS/EC to the A1 Pro or vice versa.
